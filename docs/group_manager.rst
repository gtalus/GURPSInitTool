Group Manager
=============

The group manager allows you to organize and save combatant records between sessions, making them more easily available to quickly create an encounter during a game session. It is accessed by cliking the right-most icon on the toolbar or pressing Alt+G, which brings up the Group Manager window.

There are three major components in the Group Manager- at the upper right is the tree view which organizes folders and groups. Below that is the combatant table and to the right is the combatant details pane which can be hidden from the 'View' menu. The view menu also has an option to automatically adjust the column width of the combatant table which is set by default.

Managing Groups
---------------
To creat folders and groups, right click on the tree view window and select one of the options. The right-click menu can also be used to rename or delete folders or groups. 

Once you have created a group, you can begin adding combatants by selecting the group and then editing the 'new...' row in the combatant table below. This table has most of the same functionality of the initiative table in the main program window as does the details panel on the right.

Organizing the tree view is primarily done through dragging the folders or groups to their new location. You can also copy combatant records between groups by selecting and dragging them from the table to the destination group in the tree above.

.. note:: Hitting the 'ESC' key during any drag operation will cancel it.

File Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'File' menu allows you to save or open group manager records, which by default are named with the '.igroup' extension. You will typically only need one file as you can organize many records using the tree structure.

.. note:: The last loaded file is automatically re-loaded when the program starts.

.. note:: Closing the Group Manager will not discard any changes. If you attempt to close the main initiative window without saving, a pop-up will show and warn you of the unsaved changes. 

Using Groups
------------

Adding combatants from the Group Manager to the initiative table is done by dragging and dropping. There are two options: first, you can drag an entire group from the tree view to the initiative table. Second, you can select rows from the combatant table in the group manager and drag them across to the initiative table. You can also do this in reverse, for example if you want to save an un-finished encounter for next session.
