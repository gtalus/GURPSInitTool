.. GURPSInitTool documentation master file

Welcome to GURPSInitTool's documentation!
=========================================

Introduction
------------

GURPSInitTool is a combat tracking and automation tool. It tracks initiative and each combatant's status while automating common or repetitive tasks for the GM. It avoids automating the PCs and allows the GM to quickly override the NPC automations when desired. Specific automations- or all automation- can also be disabled.

In addition to combat tracking, the program provides a Group Manager which can keep a library of creatures and encounters for quick access during a session.
